# Codenames in React
For blips & giggles while we're all working remotely due to covid-19.

In its current state, this thing is meant to be used in video conference
with `share screen` capabilities like Zoom.

One of the spy masters would have to generate the board, take a `screenshot` of the `spymaster view`
and send a copy to the other spy master in a private chat.

Then and only then can the board be shared with the rest of the room.

## Will probably continue working on this for better UX
Good enough for now...
